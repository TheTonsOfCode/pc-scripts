# clean-js

Cleans up old Node.js and Next.js projects by removing auto-generated files. This allows you to archive old source code while freeing up disk space.

**Usage:**

1.  Move all your old projects into a dedicated folder (e.g., `olds`).
2.  Navigate into the `olds` directory in your terminal: `cd olds`
3.  Run the `clean-js` script.
4.  The script will display a list of directories that will be removed. Review this list carefully.
5.  Type `yes` and press Enter to confirm the deletion.
